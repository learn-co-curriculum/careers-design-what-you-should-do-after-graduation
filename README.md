# Design - What You Should Be Doing After Graduation

## Keep Designing

You have downtime while job hunting, so you should be continuing you skills. Doing so will keep your skills sharp and you may even end up with projects that you can include in your portfolio. This could mean more reading, more design exercises or assignments and more design networking. 

Add to your portfolio, learn new skills, take on pro bono or freelance projects, take part in a hackathon. If your portfolio looks the same in six months as it does today, in terms of content, recruiters and hiring managers will have no reason to take a chance on you. You’ll be stale.

Below are resources to help you practice and keep your design skills fresh:

- [Up Labs](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges)
- [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/)
- [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/)

You get to keep your access to your curriculum, so leverage that to read anything you skipped over, refresh yourself on the content, and hit up extra credit assignments. Remember those long resource lists? Time to check those out. 

## Stay on Top of Design News and Trends

This information has already been shared with you, but now that you are in a space you can dig in deeper, we wanted to remind you of the resources available to you.

**Podcasts**

The design industry is constantly evolving and moving at a rapid pace. A great way to stay abreast of all these changes is to listen to podcasts to hear insights from leading figures. It's something you can listen to in the background while driving, working out, or multi-tasking. Podcasts also allow you to hear first-hand from designers how they work and think, and you will start to develop a comfort level with what it means to be a designer.
